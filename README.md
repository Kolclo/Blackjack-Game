To do:
1.  ~~Stop user from starting new games if they don't have the funds to do so.~~
2.  ~~Increase text size to make current cards easier to see.~~
3.  ~~Allow user to press enter key instead of pressing the "Start Game" button on the initial screen.~~
4.  ~~Modify contents of one of the "Start Game" buttons so it's more clear that they are different buttons.~~
